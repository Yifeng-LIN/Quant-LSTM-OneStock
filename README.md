# Open-quant
Open-source LSTM chain for quant

What the code is for ?
This is an open source chain for testing trading opportunities, it allows to:
- Get financial information from Quandl, and define wanted financial technical indicators,
- Set up a LSTM model to "learn the knowledge" from the training set,
- Then make prediction in order to provide trading signals for the test set,
- And run Backtrader to test the strategy performance.
The chain includes the following modulus:
1) Main.py is the main code to run the different modules;
2) A_Parameters.py defines the parameters (buy/short threshold, superparameters, train/test set etc.) for iterate testings;
3) B_SourceData.py defines the sources of financial information and technical indicators, needed for the machine learning model;
4) C_StructureData.py is the module allowing restructuring the data, defining the variables and labels for the supervised learning;
5) D_ModelTrain.py defines the LSTM model architecture, and runs the training process;
6) E_PredicAll.py allows to make prediction for the test data set;
7) F_BackTesting.py allows to run the backtrader program, and provide backtesting results for the training and testing data sets.

How to run the code ?
In order the run this chain, you need to:
- get an Quandl key and put it into the B_SourceData.py,
- set up python 3.5 environment
- install libraries (keras, numpy, pandas, quandl, talib, matplotlib, sklearn, datetime, backtrader)
